*This post is my recap of Leslie Lamport's amazing paper called ["Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System"](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/time-clocks.pdf)*

When you first start using cloud-based solutions you're quickly amazed by the infinite scale at the tip of your fingers. And by the tip of your fingers, I mean that. All it takes for you to set up a system that can work for a mom-and-pop shop as well as for a multinational corporation is a few clicks. And for a while, I was happy with learning just the surface-level stuff. Learning how to use the technologies without a deep understanding. But then I stumbled across a [series of blog posts by Google](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/after-lambda-exactly-once-processing-in-google-cloud-dataflow-part-1), talking about how they designed Dataflow. And that whet my appetite. But how do you get started digging deeper into distributed systems? After some research I came across one of the most fundamental issues needing to be solved in any distributed system: ordering of events in a networked environment.

# Why is it hard to order events in a distributed system?
The main issue introduced when you move from a single, monolithic, approched to a computational system is ordering events with networking involved. Ask anyone who has ever worked with networking and they'll have a nightmare story of how a single switch failure took up their entire weekend. With computer networking you introduce not only hardware failure but also latencies. The paper from Lamport tackles the second part of that issue: latency.

I can already hear you asking: *"So why is latency an issue for order? Don't we have TCP?"* Well in a distributed system you don't just have a single dependency (one client for one host). There's a possiblity of chained requests whose order still matters in the target system. Below is a quick illustration of how this can go wrong. We have three processes, with process one acting as a ledger. For simplicity, each colored arrow is annotated with the ordered number of which a message is sent and that number is also the payload. Message 3, in this case, is dependent on recevingin message 2 before it can be sent.

{: refdef}

As you can see, the expected result is `[1, 3]` but the observed result is `[3, 1]` due to high latency between P2 and P1.

# So what's the solution?
Lamport's solution has two parts:
1. Attach a timestamp to each message
2. Whenever a message is received, the receiving process is resposible for setting its clock to t+1

What this means is that the P1 can always trust the timestamp it receives from child processes and can amend its list of values.

For those who know their distributed systems already, these graphs will look very familiar. That is because this is the start of [Paxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)), another famous work of Lampart that I will cover in a future post.
