I've never taken the straight path in life. Sparing you all a very long story but at the end of my journey I arrived at data engineering as my chosen profession. And one I want to become the best at. Why? Because I found my passion: distributed systems. The offloading of processing across multiple nodes across a network, and the challenges it introduces, is a source of endless fascination for me. And I'm not happy "just" learning how the end product works. No, I want to know the theory behind it.

But professional life is just part of who a person is. In my spare time I enjoy playing chess, going to football matches, and I've recently picked up hiking to get away from it all for a moment.

This is a very brief look into what I'm about and it's, honestly, about what I'm comfortable to share on the public internet.
